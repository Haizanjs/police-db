# Arma Police Database
## Build Version 1.1.3
### Created by Colton Brister
### Documentation: https://github.com/ColeB97/A3-Police-Database/wiki

This project was started in 2015 for the game server, Life-Studios. Over time I slowly built it up to what it is today, it was a huge learning tool for me and has helped me get to where I am today. Without the help of Scott Harm I would have never been able to complete it.

For 2 years this project was kept private and only a few communities have been allowed to use it, well as my time has come to an end with gaming, I’m releasing it to the public for use. I will no longer continue development on this except for bug fixes. I encourage the community to keep building it, and that’s why I am releasing it on Github.
